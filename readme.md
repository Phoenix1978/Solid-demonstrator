SOLID principles demonstrator
========

**This project aims to demonstrate the SOLID principles :**

The SOLID principles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) aim on helping for software development more reliable and more robust
## Acronym meaning 
#### Single-responsibility
	A class, method or function should only have a single responsibility
      prevents unexpected side-effects of future changes, much easier to explain, understand and implement
#### Open–closed
	An application entity (class, function, module ...) must be open to extension, but closed to modification
	      avoid affecting non-wanted code 
#### Liskov substitution
	Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program (do not change superclass behavior in subtype)
                 loosely dependent to each other and encourages code reusability
				 
#### Interface segregation
	Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
                Avoid huge interface with bad readability
				
#### Dependency inversion
	Depend on abstractions, not implementations
                Avoid dependencies that may change


### General cons :
	Sometimes it can be felt more complex
	More objects (classes / functions /methods)

Other acronym like this one:
DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself (make code reusable, divide logic)
KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid (choose simplest way to code)
YAGNI: You aren't gonna need it (don’t add code until deemed necessity)



### How it work
This project was done on IntelliJ with Maven, so simply import the project and launch the src\main\java\Tester.java

To be useful, it is worthy to follow as much the code and logs meanwhile

Enjoy !
